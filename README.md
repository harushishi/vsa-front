# video-sharing-app (front-end)
Kind of a social network thingy. Main idea is to allow the user to upload videos/images along with a desired text content that will be shown in his profile and in other users feeds if they follow him. He also will be able to upload a profile picture that can be updated later on. Hoping to also add a private live chat between users, being able to interact with other users posts be it either via leaving a comment or liking it.

Initially I wasn't going to build the front-end for this project but I figured out it'd be a good challenge to get some practice on frontend skills. Main goal on this is to improve at React. Also trying out Bootstrap to see how it goes. CSS is my weakest point by far, but i'll tackle it soon and get better w/ my raw css skills.
